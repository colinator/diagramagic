Use svg++ as standard SVG plus diag extensions.
Start with a top-level column flex for page structure.
Use nested row/column flex instead of manual y-coordinate math.
Template repeated components (3+ uses) with diag:template/diag:instance.
Use diag:wrap="true" for multi-word text blocks.
Use stable id attributes on connected elements before adding diag:arrow.
For diag:arrow, set from/to to element ids or diag:anchor ids (not template names or labels).
Use diag:anchor when you need precise connection points or timeline-style alignment.
Prefer diag:graph over manual coordinates for flowcharts, architecture graphs, dependency graphs, and pipelines.
Use diag:include for large reusable subgraphs instead of inlining very large trees.
Use <g transform="..."> to move/scale groups.
Mix raw SVG (lines, arrows, paths) with svg++ layout freely.
Assign stable id attributes for focused render and targeted updates.
